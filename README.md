## 📝 Description

This is a HTML5 implementation of an etch-a-sketch. The user can drag a mouse across the drawing area and leave marks to create a picture. They can also change the size of the canvas along with changing the color of the color being put on th ecanvas. It was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This was the first time I learned about DOM manipulation, and a lot of this project was focused on practicing that.
